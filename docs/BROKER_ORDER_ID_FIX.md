# Bug Fix: Dependent Orders Losing broker_order_id

**Date:** 2025-10-17  
**Issue:** Take profit/stop loss orders submitted successfully to Alpaca but lose their `broker_order_id` in the database  
**Severity:** HIGH - Orders cannot be tracked or managed without broker_order_id

## Problem Description

When TradeManager processes WAITING_TRIGGER orders and submits them to the broker, the orders are successfully created at the broker and receive a `broker_order_id`. However, this ID is immediately overwritten with `None` in the database.

### Example from Logs

**Order 190** - Take profit for AMD position:

```
# Step 1: Order successfully submitted to Alpaca
2025-10-13 15:32:12,024 - AlpacaAccount - INFO - Successfully submitted order to Alpaca: broker_order_id=ca86afc1-e20e-4b67-8b14-bfd3425d0af7

# Step 2: 34 seconds later, broker_order_id LOST!
2025-10-13 15:32:45,972 - AlpacaAccount - INFO - Updated order 190 in database: broker_order_id=None, status=OrderStatus.WAITING_TRIGGER
```

The order was submitted successfully with ID `ca86afc1-e20e-4b67-8b14-bfd3425d0af7`, but then the database was updated with `broker_order_id=None`.

## Root Cause

**File:** `ba2_trade_platform/core/TradeManager.py`  
**Lines:** 400-406

### The Bug

```python
# Line 400: Submit order to broker
submitted_order = account.submit_order(dependent_order)

if submitted_order:
    # ❌ BUG: Modifying the STALE dependent_order object
    dependent_order.status = OrderStatus.OPEN
    session.add(dependent_order)  # ❌ Overwrites database with stale object
    self.logger.info(f"Successfully submitted dependent order {dependent_order.id}")
    triggered_orders.append(dependent_order.id)
```

### What Happens

1. **TradeManager loads order from database**
   - `dependent_order` has `broker_order_id=None` (WAITING_TRIGGER state)
   
2. **submit_order() is called**
   - Order is submitted to Alpaca → receives broker_order_id `ca86afc1-e20e-4b67-8b14-bfd3425d0af7`
   - `submit_order()` updates database with fresh broker_order_id
   - Returns `submitted_order` (fresh object with broker_order_id)
   
3. **TradeManager overwrites the database** ❌
   - Modifies the STALE `dependent_order` object (still has `broker_order_id=None`)
   - Calls `session.add(dependent_order)` 
   - This overwrites the fresh data with stale data!

### Why This Happens

SQLAlchemy session tracking issue:
- `dependent_order` was loaded at the start of the method
- Inside `submit_order()`, a NEW database session loads and updates the same order
- When TradeManager calls `session.add(dependent_order)`, it overwrites with the stale object
- The fresh `broker_order_id` is lost

## The Fix

**File:** `ba2_trade_platform/core/TradeManager.py`  
**Lines:** 400-406

### Fixed Code

```python
# Line 400: Submit order to broker
submitted_order = account.submit_order(dependent_order)

if submitted_order:
    # ✅ FIX: Refresh dependent_order from database to get latest state
    session.refresh(dependent_order)
    self.logger.info(f"Successfully submitted dependent order {dependent_order.id}")
    triggered_orders.append(dependent_order.id)
```

### Changes Made

1. **Removed stale status update**: Deleted `dependent_order.status = OrderStatus.OPEN`
   - Status is already set correctly by `submit_order()`
   
2. **Removed session.add()**: Deleted `session.add(dependent_order)`
   - No need to add stale object back to session
   
3. **Added session.refresh()**: `session.refresh(dependent_order)`
   - Refreshes `dependent_order` from database
   - Picks up the fresh `broker_order_id` set by `submit_order()`
   - Ensures TradeManager works with current data

## Impact

### Before Fix ❌
- Dependent orders (TP/SL) submitted successfully to broker
- `broker_order_id` lost immediately after submission
- Orders cannot be tracked, updated, or canceled
- Manual intervention required to fix database

### After Fix ✅
- Dependent orders retain their `broker_order_id`
- Orders can be tracked and managed normally
- No data loss between submission and database update
- System works as designed

## Testing

### Verification Steps

1. Create a market order with take profit
2. Wait for market order to fill
3. TradeManager should submit TP order
4. Check database: `broker_order_id` should be present
5. Check Alpaca broker: Order should exist with matching ID

### Expected Behavior

```sql
-- Order should have broker_order_id after submission
SELECT id, symbol, broker_order_id, status, comment 
FROM tradingorder 
WHERE id = 190;

-- Result should show:
-- id: 190
-- broker_order_id: ca86afc1-e20e-4b67-8b14-bfd3425d0af7 ✅
-- status: OPEN (or FILLED, CANCELED, etc.)
-- comment: "TP for order 189"
```

## Related Code Patterns

This pattern appears in multiple places. Other locations to review:

### TradeManager._process_waiting_trigger_orders()
- **Line 249**: Also updates dependent orders after submission
- Same pattern, may have same issue

### Recommended Pattern for Order Updates

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Let submit_order handle the update
submitted_order = account.submit_order(order)
if submitted_order:
    # Refresh local object to get fresh data
    session.refresh(order)
    # Work with refreshed object
    
# ❌ WRONG: Modify and re-add stale object
submitted_order = account.submit_order(order)
if submitted_order:
    order.status = OrderStatus.OPEN  # Stale object!
    session.add(order)  # Overwrites fresh data!
```

## Additional Safety Measures

To prevent any future broker_order_id overwrites, added protective checks in all locations that set broker_order_id:

### Protected Locations

1. **AlpacaAccount.submit_order()** (Line 432-443)
   ```python
   # Check before overwriting
   if fresh_order.broker_order_id and fresh_order.broker_order_id != new_broker_order_id:
       logger.warning(f"Order {fresh_order.id} already has broker_order_id={fresh_order.broker_order_id}, "
                     f"not overwriting with new value: {new_broker_order_id}")
   else:
       fresh_order.broker_order_id = new_broker_order_id
   ```

2. **TradeActions.close_position()** (Line 482-492)
   ```python
   # Check before overwriting
   if order_record.broker_order_id and order_record.broker_order_id != new_broker_id:
       logger.warning(f"Order {order_record.id} already has broker_order_id, not overwriting")
   else:
       order_record.broker_order_id = new_broker_id
   ```

3. **TradeActions.adjust_stop_loss()** (Line 1017-1027)
   - Same protective check for stop loss orders

4. **overview.py manual mapping** (Line 2120-2126)
   - Warns when overwriting existing broker_order_id during manual mapping

### Protection Logic

All broker_order_id assignments now follow this pattern:
```python
new_broker_id = get_new_broker_id()

# ✅ SAFE: Check before overwriting
if existing_broker_id and existing_broker_id != new_broker_id:
    logger.warning(f"Not overwriting existing broker_order_id: {existing_broker_id}")
else:
    order.broker_order_id = new_broker_id
```

## Prevention

### Code Review Checklist

When working with database objects across method boundaries:

- [ ] Does the method call update the database internally?
- [ ] Are we modifying the object after the method call?
- [ ] Could the object be stale after the method returns?
- [ ] Should we refresh() instead of modify + add()?
- [ ] Is broker_order_id protected from accidental overwrites?

### SQLAlchemy Best Practices

1. **Refresh after external updates**: If a method updates the database, refresh the object
2. **Avoid session.add() for tracked objects**: Object is already in session, don't re-add
3. **Use returned objects**: If method returns a fresh object, use that instead of stale one
4. **One source of truth**: Let one layer handle updates, others should read
5. **Protect critical IDs**: Add checks before overwriting broker_order_id or similar fields
