# Balance Usage Chart Refactor & Session Fix

## Summary
This update refactors the Balance Usage Per Expert chart to use transaction-based calculations instead of order-based, adds proper tracking of order execution prices, and fixes a critical SQLAlchemy session attachment error.

## Changes Overview

### 1. TradingOrder Model Enhancement

#### New Fields Added
**File**: `ba2_trade_platform/core/models.py`

Added two new fields to the `TradingOrder` model:

```python
filled_avg_price: float | None = Field(default=None, description="Average price at which the order was filled")
open_price: float | None = Field(default=None, description="Price at which the order opened (for filled orders)")
```

**Purpose**:
- `filled_avg_price`: Stores the actual average execution price from the broker
- `open_price`: Stores the price used for position calculations (same as filled_avg_price for filled orders)

**Benefits**:
- Accurate tracking of order execution prices
- Better position value calculations
- Historical price data for analytics

### 2. Alpaca Account Integration

#### Updated Order Conversion
**File**: `ba2_trade_platform/modules/accounts/AlpacaAccount.py`

**Method**: `alpaca_order_to_tradingorder()`
- Now extracts `filled_avg_price` from Alpaca orders
- Sets `open_price` to match `filled_avg_price` for filled orders

**Method**: `refresh_orders()`
- Syncs `filled_avg_price` from broker to database
- Syncs `open_price` from broker to database
- Logs all price updates for debugging

**Code Added**:
```python
# Update filled_avg_price if it changed
if alpaca_order.filled_avg_price and (db_order.filled_avg_price is None or float(db_order.filled_avg_price) != float(alpaca_order.filled_avg_price)):
    logger.debug(f"Order {db_order.id} filled_avg_price changed: {db_order.filled_avg_price} -> {alpaca_order.filled_avg_price}")
    db_order.filled_avg_price = alpaca_order.filled_avg_price
    has_changes = True

# Update open_price if it changed (use filled_avg_price)
if alpaca_order.open_price and (db_order.open_price is None or float(db_order.open_price) != float(alpaca_order.open_price)):
    logger.debug(f"Order {db_order.id} open_price changed: {db_order.open_price} -> {alpaca_order.open_price}")
    db_order.open_price = alpaca_order.open_price
    has_changes = True
```

### 3. Transaction Model - New Helper Methods

#### Quantity Calculation Methods

**Method**: `get_current_open_qty() -> float`

Calculates total filled quantity for the transaction:
- Only counts orders with FILLED/EXECUTED status
- BUY orders add to quantity (positive)
- SELL orders subtract from quantity (negative)
- Returns net filled quantity

**Example**:
```python
transaction = get_instance(Transaction, 1)
filled_qty = transaction.get_current_open_qty()
# Returns: 10.0 for 10 shares long, -5.0 for 5 shares short
```

---

**Method**: `get_pending_open_qty() -> float`

Calculates total pending unfilled quantity:
- Only counts orders with OPEN/PENDING status
- Excludes dependent orders (TP/SL)
- Subtracts partially filled quantities
- BUY orders add to quantity (positive)
- SELL orders subtract from quantity (negative)

**Example**:
```python
transaction = get_instance(Transaction, 1)
pending_qty = transaction.get_pending_open_qty()
# Returns: 5.0 if 5 shares pending buy, -3.0 if 3 shares pending sell
```

---

#### Equity Calculation Methods

**Method**: `get_current_open_equity(account_interface=None) -> float`

Calculates dollar value of filled positions:
- Uses `open_price` from filled orders
- Falls back to `filled_avg_price` if `open_price` not available
- Formula: `sum(abs(filled_qty) × open_price)`

**Example**:
```python
transaction = get_instance(Transaction, 1)
filled_equity = transaction.get_current_open_equity()
# Returns: 1000.0 for 10 shares @ $100
```

---

**Method**: `get_pending_open_equity(account_interface) -> float`

Calculates dollar value of pending orders:
- Uses current market price from account interface
- Only counts unfilled portions of orders
- Excludes dependent orders (TP/SL)
- Formula: `sum(abs(remaining_qty) × market_price)`
- Returns 0.0 if market price unavailable

**Example**:
```python
from modules.accounts import AlpacaAccount
account = AlpacaAccount(account_id=1)
transaction = get_instance(Transaction, 1)
pending_equity = transaction.get_pending_open_equity(account)
# Returns: 500.0 for 5 shares pending @ $100 market price
```

### 4. Balance Usage Chart Refactor

**File**: `ba2_trade_platform/ui/components/BalanceUsagePerExpertChart.py`

#### Old Approach (Order-Based)
- Iterated through all orders with expert_id
- Calculated value based on order prices (limit/stop/filled_avg)
- Complex logic for partially filled orders
- No transaction context

#### New Approach (Transaction-Based)
- Queries transactions with OPENED/WAITING status
- Uses Transaction helper methods for calculations
- Groups by expert_id from transaction
- Cleaner, more accurate calculations

#### Key Changes

**Data Source Changed**:
```python
# OLD: Query orders
orders = session.exec(
    select(TradingOrder)
    .where(TradingOrder.expert_id.isnot(None))
).all()

# NEW: Query transactions
transactions = session.exec(
    select(Transaction)
    .where(Transaction.expert_id.isnot(None))
    .where(Transaction.status.in_([TransactionStatus.OPENED, TransactionStatus.WAITING]))
).all()
```

**Calculation Logic**:
```python
# For each transaction:
filled_equity = transaction.get_current_open_equity(account_interface)
pending_equity = transaction.get_pending_open_equity(account_interface)

balance_usage[expert_name]['filled'] += filled_equity
balance_usage[expert_name]['pending'] += pending_equity
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ More accurate (uses actual transaction positions)
- ✅ Simpler code (delegates to Transaction methods)
- ✅ Better performance (fewer queries)
- ✅ Proper handling of market prices for pending orders
- ✅ Excludes TP/SL dependent orders automatically

### 5. Database Session Attachment Fix

**File**: `ba2_trade_platform/core/db.py`

#### Problem
When closing a transaction, the code would:
1. Query orders with session A
2. Try to delete order using `delete_instance()` which creates session B
3. SQLAlchemy error: "Object already attached to session A (this is B)"

#### Solution
Modified `delete_instance()` to properly handle session attachment:

```python
def delete_instance(instance, session: Session | None = None):
    with _db_write_lock:
        try:
            instance_id = instance.id
            model_class = type(instance)
            
            if session:
                # Re-fetch instance in the provided session to avoid attachment issues
                merged_instance = session.get(model_class, instance_id)
                if merged_instance:
                    session.delete(merged_instance)
                    session.commit()
                    return True
            else:
                # Create new session and fetch instance
                with Session(engine) as new_session:
                    merged_instance = new_session.get(model_class, instance_id)
                    if merged_instance:
                        new_session.delete(merged_instance)
                        new_session.commit()
                        return True
```

**Key Changes**:
1. Extracts `instance_id` and `model_class` from passed instance
2. Re-fetches the instance using `session.get()` in the target session
3. Deletes the re-fetched instance (properly attached to current session)
4. Handles case where instance doesn't exist in database

**File**: `ba2_trade_platform/ui/pages/overview.py`

Updated `_close_position()` to pass session:
```python
# OLD: delete_instance(order)  # Creates new session internally

# NEW: delete_instance(order, session=session)  # Uses existing session
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No more session attachment errors
- ✅ Proper transaction handling
- ✅ Thread-safe with existing lock
- ✅ Better error handling

## Migration Notes

### Database Changes
The addition of `filled_avg_price` and `open_price` fields requires a database migration or recreation.

**Option 1: Automatic (SQLite)**
- SQLite will auto-migrate on next run if using alembic
- Existing orders will have `NULL` for new fields

**Option 2: Manual Migration**
```sql
ALTER TABLE tradingorder ADD COLUMN filled_avg_price FLOAT;
ALTER TABLE tradingorder ADD COLUMN open_price FLOAT;
```

### Existing Data
- Existing orders will have `NULL` for `filled_avg_price` and `open_price`
- Next `refresh_orders()` call will populate these fields from broker
- Chart calculations will work correctly (methods handle `None` values)

---

## Testing Checklist

### Order Price Tracking
- [ ] Create new order and verify `filled_avg_price` populated after fill
- [ ] Verify `open_price` matches `filled_avg_price` for filled orders
- [ ] Check `refresh_orders()` updates both fields from broker
- [ ] Verify partial fills have correct prices

### Transaction Methods
- [ ] Test `get_current_open_qty()` with various order combinations
- [ ] Test `get_pending_open_qty()` excludes TP/SL orders
- [ ] Test `get_current_open_equity()` with filled orders
- [ ] Test `get_pending_open_equity()` uses market price
- [ ] Verify methods return 0 when no matching orders exist

### Balance Usage Chart
- [ ] Chart displays experts with active positions
- [ ] Filled equity shows correct values
- [ ] Pending equity uses current market prices
- [ ] Chart updates after closing positions
- [ ] No errors with NULL prices in old orders

### Session Fix
- [ ] Close transaction with WAITING_TRIGGER orders
- [ ] Verify no "already attached to session" errors
- [ ] Check orders are properly deleted from database
- [ ] Verify transaction status updates to CLOSED
- [ ] Test concurrent transaction closes (thread safety)

---

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization
**Before**: Queried all orders, then filtered and grouped
**After**: Queries only active transactions, delegates calculations

**Expected Impact**:
- Fewer database queries (transactions vs all orders)
- Better indexing (transaction status + expert_id)
- Faster calculations (delegated to methods with focused queries)

### Caching Opportunities
Currently no caching implemented, but could add:
- Cache market prices for short duration (avoid multiple API calls per refresh)
- Cache expert balance calculations (invalidate on order updates)

---

## Error Handling

All new methods include proper error handling:

1. **Transaction Methods**:
   - Handle missing orders gracefully
   - Return 0.0 for empty results
   - Log calculation errors without crashing

2. **Chart Calculation**:
   - Catches per-transaction errors
   - Continues processing other transactions
   - Logs detailed error information

3. **Session Management**:
   - Handles instance not found in database
   - Proper session cleanup on errors
   - Thread-safe with existing locks

---

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term
- [ ] Add caching for market prices in pending equity calculation
- [ ] Create database index on (transaction_id, status) for faster queries
- [ ] Add logging for equity calculation debugging

### Long-term
- [ ] Historical balance usage tracking (time-series data)
- [ ] Balance usage alerts (notify when expert exceeds threshold)
- [ ] Balance allocation optimization recommendations
- [ ] API endpoint for programmatic balance usage queries

---

## Breaking Changes

None. All changes are backward compatible:
- New fields have default `None` values
- Old code continues to work without modifications
- Chart gracefully handles NULL prices in legacy data
