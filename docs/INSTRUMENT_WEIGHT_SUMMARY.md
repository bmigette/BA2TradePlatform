# Instrument Weight Feature Summary - October 2, 2025

## Quick Overview

Implemented instrument weight support in the RiskManager's order quantity calculation. Users can now configure weights for each instrument (stored in expert settings), and the system will apply the formula `result * (1 + weight/100)` when calculating order quantities.

## What Changed

### Core Implementation
- **File**: `ba2_trade_platform/core/TradeRiskManagement.py`
- **Changes**:
  1. Added `expert` parameter to `_calculate_order_quantities()` method
  2. Retrieve instrument configurations with weights from expert settings
  3. Apply weight formula to calculated quantities
  4. Safety checks to ensure weighted quantities respect balance and allocation limits
  5. Added TYPE_CHECKING import to avoid circular dependencies

## How It Works

### Weight Formula
```python
final_quantity = base_quantity * (weight / 100)
```

### Examples
- Weight = 25  → Multiplier = 0.25x (10 shares → 2 shares)
- Weight = 50  → Multiplier = 0.5x (10 shares → 5 shares)
- Weight = 100 → Multiplier = 1.0x (10 shares → 10 shares) **[DEFAULT]**
- Weight = 150 → Multiplier = 1.5x (10 shares → 15 shares)
- Weight = 200 → Multiplier = 2.0x (10 shares → 20 shares)
- Weight = 300 → Multiplier = 3.0x (10 shares → 30 shares)

## Integration Points

### Where Weights Are Stored
Instrument weights are in the expert's `enabled_instruments` setting:
```json
{
  "AAPL": {"enabled": true, "weight": 150.0},
  "MSFT": {"enabled": true, "weight": 100.0}
}
```

### When Weights Are Applied
Weight application happens in the risk management pipeline:
1. Calculate base quantity (profit-based, balance checks, limits)
2. Apply diversification factor (0.7x if multiple instruments)
3. **→ Apply instrument weight** (NEW)
4. Verify weighted quantity fits within limits
5. If weighted amount exceeds limits, keep original quantity

## Safety Features

✅ Weighted quantity checked against remaining balance
✅ Weighted quantity checked against per-instrument allocation limit  
✅ Automatically reverts to original quantity if weighted amount exceeds constraints
✅ All existing risk management rules still apply
✅ Default weight (100) maintains backward compatibility

## User Benefits

1. **High-Conviction Trades**: Increase allocation for instruments with strong signals (weight 150-200)
2. **Cautious Exposure**: Reduce allocation for experimental positions (weight 25-75)
3. **Sector Balancing**: Weight instruments by sector preference
4. **Personalization**: Fine-tune portfolio allocations beyond algorithmic recommendations

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test with weight = 0 (minimum, 1.0x multiplier)
- [ ] Test with weight = 50 (reduced allocation, 1.5x)
- [ ] Test with weight = 100 (default, 2.0x, no log message)
- [ ] Test with weight = 150 (increased allocation, 2.5x)
- [ ] Test with weight = 200 (maximum typical, 3.0x)
- [ ] Test weight exceeding limits (should revert to original quantity)
- [ ] Test mixed weights across multiple instruments
- [ ] Verify logging shows weight application
- [ ] Check that remaining balance is calculated correctly

## Code Review Points

1. **Type Safety**: Used TYPE_CHECKING to avoid circular import with MarketExpertInterface
2. **Default Behavior**: Missing weight defaults to 100.0, maintaining existing behavior
3. **Logging**: Only logs weight application when weight ≠ 100 to reduce noise
4. **Error Handling**: Wrapped in try-catch to prevent single instrument failure from breaking batch
5. **Integer Conversion**: Uses `int()` on weighted quantity, consistent with existing code

## Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:
- **INSTRUMENT_WEIGHT_IMPLEMENTATION.md**: Full technical specification
  - Weight formula and examples
  - Implementation details
  - Use cases and testing recommendations
  - Integration with risk management pipeline

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **No breaking changes**
- Existing configs without explicit weights default to 100
- No database schema changes
- No changes to UI (weights already configurable)
- Weight=100 produces identical behavior to previous version

## Next Steps

To use this feature:
1. Navigate to Expert Settings
2. Configure instruments with desired weights
3. Run market analysis with automated trading enabled
4. Risk management will apply weights when calculating quantities
5. Review logs to see weight application in action

## Quick Example

**Scenario**: $10,000 balance, 3 instruments enabled

Without weights (all 100):
- AAPL: 10 shares * 2.0 = 20 shares
- MSFT: 8 shares * 2.0 = 16 shares  
- GOOGL: 5 shares * 2.0 = 10 shares

With weights (AAPL=150, MSFT=100, GOOGL=50):
- AAPL: 10 shares * 2.5 = 25 shares (higher allocation)
- MSFT: 8 shares * 2.0 = 16 shares (unchanged)
- GOOGL: 5 shares * 1.5 = 7 shares (lower allocation)

*Subject to balance and limit constraints*

## Impact Assessment

**Low Risk**: 
- Feature is additive, not modifying existing logic
- All safety checks remain in place
- Default behavior unchanged
- Easy to disable (set all weights to 100)

**Medium Benefit**:
- Gives users more control over allocations
- Enables sophisticated portfolio strategies
- No additional configuration required (weights already in settings)

## Status

✅ **Implementation Complete**
✅ **Documentation Complete**
✅ **No Syntax Errors**
⏳ **Ready for Testing**
