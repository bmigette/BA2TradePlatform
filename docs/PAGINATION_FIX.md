# Job Monitoring Pagination Fix

## Issue
The pagination controls in the Job Monitoring tab were not updating properly when navigating between pages. Specifically:
- Clicking "Next" would advance to the next page
- However, the "Previous" button remained greyed out/disabled
- Could not navigate back to previous pages or first page

## Root Cause
The pagination controls were created once during initial render and never updated afterwards. When `refresh_data()` was called after page changes, it would update the table data and recalculate page numbers, but the actual button states (enabled/disabled) were never refreshed.

## Solution
Implemented a container-based approach to dynamically recreate pagination controls:

### Changes Made

1. **Added `pagination_container` attribute** (Line 23)
   - Stores reference to the container holding pagination controls
   - Allows clearing and recreating controls on demand

2. **Modified `render()` method** (Lines 78-80)
   - Creates a dedicated container for pagination controls
   - Wraps `_create_pagination_controls()` call within this container

3. **Updated `_create_pagination_controls()` method** (Lines 236-274)
   - Added logic to clear existing controls if container exists
   - Now recreates all controls from scratch each time it's called
   - Properly evaluates current_page to set button enabled/disabled states

4. **Fixed `refresh_data()` method** (Line 416)
   - Now calls `_create_pagination_controls()` after updating table
   - Ensures pagination buttons reflect current page state

## How It Works Now

1. User clicks "Next" button
2. `_change_page()` updates `self.current_page`
3. `refresh_data()` is called
4. Table data is updated for new page
5. `_create_pagination_controls()` is called
6. Container is cleared of old controls
7. New controls are created with correct enabled/disabled states
8. Previous button now works correctly if not on page 1

## Testing
To verify the fix works:
1. Navigate to Market Analysis â†’ Job Monitoring tab
2. Ensure there are enough records for multiple pages (>25 records with default page size)
3. Click "Next" to go to page 2
4. Verify "Previous" button is now enabled (not greyed out)
5. Click "Previous" to return to page 1
6. Verify "Previous" button is disabled on page 1
7. Verify "Next" button is disabled on last page

## Technical Details

### Before (Broken)
```python
# Controls created once in render()
def render(self):
    self._create_pagination_controls()  # Created once, never updated

def refresh_data(self):
    self.analysis_table.update()
    # Pagination controls NOT updated - buttons stay in original state
```

### After (Fixed)
```python
# Controls stored in container and recreated on demand
def render(self):
    self.pagination_container = ui.row()
    with self.pagination_container:
        self._create_pagination_controls()

def _create_pagination_controls(self):
    if self.pagination_container is not None:
        self.pagination_container.clear()  # Clear old controls
    # Create fresh controls with current state
    
def refresh_data(self):
    self.analysis_table.update()
    self._create_pagination_controls()  # Recreate controls with new state
```
