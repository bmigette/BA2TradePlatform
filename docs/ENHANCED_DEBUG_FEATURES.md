# Enhanced Debug Features - Complete Calculated Values & Force Actions

**Date**: October 7, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Complete - All Tests Passing

## Overview

Enhanced the ruleset testing system with two major improvements:
1. **Complete Calculated Values**: All numeric conditions now display their calculated values for better debugging
2. **Force Actions Mode**: Generate actions even when conditions fail to see what actions would have been triggered

## Problem Statement

### Issue 1: Missing Calculated Values
When testing rulesets, some conditions didn't show their calculated values, making it difficult to debug why conditions were failing:

```
trigger_3: percent_to_current_target > 5.0
Check if percent from current price to current TP for AAPL is > 5.0%
PASSED
❌  <-- NO ACTUAL VALUE SHOWN

trigger_4: percent_to_new_target > 5.0
Check if percent from current price to new expert target for AAPL is > 5.0%
FAILED
❌  <-- NO ACTUAL VALUE SHOWN
```

### Issue 2: No Way to See Actions When Conditions Fail
When conditions failed, no actions were generated, making it impossible to see what actions a rule would trigger if conditions were met.

## Solution

### 1. Complete Calculated Values Tracking

Added `calculated_value` storage to **all** numeric conditions:

#### Conditions Updated

**PercentToCurrentTargetCondition**:
```python
def evaluate(self) -> bool:
    # ... calculation logic ...
    percent_to_current_target = ((current_tp_price - current_price) / current_price) * 100
    self.calculated_value = percent_to_current_target  # Store value
    return self.operator_func(percent_to_current_target, self.value)
```

**PercentToNewTargetCondition**:
```python
def evaluate(self) -> bool:
    # ... calculation logic ...
    percent_to_new_target = ((new_target_price - current_price) / current_price) * 100
    self.calculated_value = percent_to_new_target  # Store value
    return self.operator_func(percent_to_new_target, self.value)
```

**ProfitLossAmountCondition**:
```python
def evaluate(self) -> bool:
    # ... calculation logic ...
    pl_amount = (current_price - entry_price) * quantity
    if self.existing_order.side == "sell":
        pl_amount = -pl_amount
    self.calculated_value = pl_amount  # Store value
    return self.operator_func(pl_amount, self.value)
```

**DaysOpenedCondition**:
```python
def evaluate(self) -> bool:
    # ... calculation logic ...
    days_opened = time_diff.total_seconds() / 86400
    self.calculated_value = days_opened  # Store value
    return self.operator_func(days_opened, self.value)
```

#### Complete List of Conditions with Calculated Values

Now **ALL** numeric conditions provide calculated values:

1. ✅ **ConfidenceCondition** - Shows actual confidence percentage
2. ✅ **ExpectedProfitTargetPercentCondition** - Shows expected profit %
3. ✅ **ProfitLossPercentCondition** - Shows actual P/L percentage
4. ✅ **ProfitLossAmountCondition** - Shows actual P/L dollar amount
5. ✅ **InstrumentAccountShareCondition** - Shows position % of equity
6. ✅ **PercentToCurrentTargetCondition** - Shows % distance to current TP
7. ✅ **PercentToNewTargetCondition** - Shows % distance to new expert target
8. ✅ **DaysOpenedCondition** - Shows actual days since order opened

### 2. Force Actions Debug Mode

Added new debug option to generate actions even when conditions fail.

#### Core Changes

**TradeActionEvaluator** - Added parameter:
```python
def __init__(self, account: AccountInterface, 
             instrument_name: Optional[str] = None,
             existing_transactions: Optional[List[Any]] = None, 
             evaluate_all_conditions: bool = False,
             force_generate_actions: bool = False):  # NEW
    self.force_generate_actions = force_generate_actions
```

**Modified Evaluation Logic**:
```python
# In debug mode, we can force action generation even if conditions not met
should_generate_actions = conditions_met or self.force_generate_actions

if should_generate_actions:
    if conditions_met:
        logger.info(f"Conditions met for event action: {event_action.name}")
    else:
        logger.warning(f"DEBUG MODE: Forcing action generation despite failed conditions for: {event_action.name}")
    
    # Create and store TradeAction objects
    action_summaries.extend(
        self._create_and_store_trade_actions(...)
    )
    
    # In force mode, always continue to see all possible actions
    if not event_action.continue_processing and not self.force_generate_actions:
        break
```

#### UI Changes

**Added Second Checkbox**:
```python
# Debug Options section
self.force_generate_actions_checkbox = ui.checkbox(
    'Force generate actions (even if conditions fail)',
    value=False
).classes('mb-2')
ui.label('Enable this to see what actions would be generated, regardless of condition results.').classes('text-xs text-grey-6 mb-4')
```

**Updated Evaluator Creation**:
```python
def _create_evaluator(self) -> Optional[TradeActionEvaluator]:
    evaluate_all = self.evaluate_all_conditions_checkbox.value if self.evaluate_all_conditions_checkbox else False
    force_actions = self.force_generate_actions_checkbox.value if self.force_generate_actions_checkbox else False
    
    evaluator = TradeActionEvaluator(
        account, 
        evaluate_all_conditions=evaluate_all,
        force_generate_actions=force_actions  # NEW
    )
    return evaluator
```

**Enhanced Visual Indicators**:
```python
# Show debug modes in results
debug_modes = []
if self.evaluate_all_conditions_checkbox and self.evaluate_all_conditions_checkbox.value:
    debug_modes.append('Evaluate All')
if self.force_generate_actions_checkbox and self.force_generate_actions_checkbox.value:
    debug_modes.append('Force Actions')

if debug_modes:
    with ui.row().classes('items-center gap-2 mt-2'):
        ui.icon('bug_report', size='sm').classes('text-orange-600')
        ui.label(f'Debug: {" + ".join(debug_modes)}').classes('text-xs text-orange-600 font-medium')
```

## Test Results

✅ PASS: All numeric conditions have calculated values!
```

### Test 2: Force Actions Mode
```
🔹 Without Force Actions Mode:
  Conditions Met: False
  Expected: False (confidence 75 < 90)

🔹 With Force Actions Mode:
  Conditions Met: False
  Force Generate Actions: True
  Expected: Actions should be generated despite conditions_met=False

📊 Summary:
  Normal mode - Conditions met: False
  Force mode - Conditions met: False
  Force mode - Should generate actions: True

✅ PASS: Force actions mode working correctly!
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Complete Condition Analysis

**Before** (missing values):
```
trigger_3: percent_to_current_target > 5.0
PASSED  ❌ <-- What was the actual value?

trigger_4: percent_to_new_target > 5.0
FAILED  ❌ <-- How far off was it?
```

**After** (with calculated values):
```
trigger_3: percent_to_current_target > 5.0 [actual: 20.00]
PASSED  ✅ Clear why it passed

trigger_4: percent_to_new_target > 5.0 [actual: 2.15]
FAILED  ✅ Can see it was 2.15%, needs to be > 5.0%
```

### Example 2: Using Both Debug Modes Together

**Scenario**: Testing a complex rule with multiple conditions

**Step 1**: Enable both debug modes
- ☑ Evaluate all conditions (don't stop at first failure)
- ☑ Force generate actions (even if conditions fail)

**Step 2**: Run test

**Results**:
```
📊 Test Summary
  Debug: Evaluate All + Force Actions  🐛
  
  Conditions Evaluated: 8 (all conditions tested)
  Conditions Passed: 3
  Conditions Failed: 5
  
  Actions Generated: 2 (despite conditions failing!)

📋 Rule: Adjust TP/SL on Market Change
  Conditions:
    ✅ Confidence >= 75 [actual: 80.00]
    ❌ Expected Profit >= 20 [actual: 15.00]
    ✅ Bullish Signal
    ❌ P/L % > 5.0 [actual: -2.35]
    ❌ Days Opened > 7 [actual: 3.50]
    ✅ Has Position
    ❌ % to Current Target > 10.0 [actual: 8.75]
    ❌ % to New Target > 5.0 [actual: 3.25]
  
  Actions (would be generated):
    1. ADJUST_TAKE_PROFIT +5%
    2. ADJUST_STOP_LOSS -3%
```

**Benefits**:
- See **all** condition results (not just first 2)
- See **actual values** for failed conditions (e.g., P/L was -2.35%, needed > 5.0%)
- See what **actions would be triggered** (even though conditions failed)

### Example 3: Debugging Why a Rule Isn't Triggering

**Problem**: Rule isn't triggering when you think it should

**Solution**: Use debug modes to investigate

```
Normal Mode:
  Conditions Met: False
  Actions Generated: 0
  → Can't see why or what actions would have been created

Debug Mode (Evaluate All + Force Actions):
  Conditions:
    ✅ Confidence >= 80 [actual: 85.00]
    ✅ Expected Profit >= 10 [actual: 15.00]
    ❌ % to New Target > 5.0 [actual: 2.50]  ← This is the problem!
    ✅ Has Position
  
  Actions (forced):
    1. ADJUST_TAKE_PROFIT to new target
  
  → Now you can see:
     - 3 out of 4 conditions passed
     - The failing condition only needs 2.5 more percent
     - The action that would be triggered is ADJUST_TAKE_PROFIT
```

## Benefits

### For Debugging
1. **Complete Visibility**: See actual values for ALL conditions
2. **Action Preview**: See what actions would trigger even when conditions fail
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Quickly identify which condition is blocking execution
4. **Value Inspection**: Know exactly how far off a condition is from passing

### For Development
1. **Rule Validation**: Verify all conditions are evaluating correctly
2. **Action Design**: See what actions a rule would trigger before deploying
3. **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust condition thresholds based on actual values
4. **Testing**: Test full rule behavior without waiting for conditions to be met

### For Users
1. **Understanding**: See complete picture of rule evaluation
2. **Troubleshooting**: Diagnose why rules aren't firing
3. **Optimization**: Fine-tune rules based on actual market data
4. **Learning**: Understand how different conditions interact

## Debug Mode Combinations

| Evaluate All | Force Actions | Behavior |
|--------------|---------------|----------|
| ❌ | ❌ | Normal: Stop at first failure, no actions if conditions fail |
| ✅ | ❌ | See all conditions, but no actions if any fail |
| ❌ | ✅ | Stop at first failure, but force actions anyway |
| ✅ | ✅ | **Best for debugging**: See all conditions AND all actions |

**Recommendation**: Use both modes together (✅ + ✅) for maximum debugging insight.

## Performance Considerations

### Normal Mode (Both Disabled)
- ⚡ **Fastest**: Short-circuit evaluation
- ⚡ **Optimal**: Only evaluates necessary conditions
- ⚡ **Production**: Recommended for live trading

### Evaluate All Mode Only
- 🐢 **Slower**: Evaluates all conditions
- 📊 **Thorough**: Complete condition analysis
- 🔍 **Debugging**: Good for condition troubleshooting

### Force Actions Mode Only
- ⚡ **Fast**: Same as normal for conditions
- ⚠️ **Caution**: Creates actions even when shouldn't
- 🔍 **Testing**: Only use for testing/preview

### Both Modes Enabled
- 🐢 **Slowest**: Maximum evaluation
- 📊 **Complete**: Full analysis + all actions
- 🔍 **Best for Debugging**: Maximum insight
- ⚠️ **Never in Production**: Testing only
