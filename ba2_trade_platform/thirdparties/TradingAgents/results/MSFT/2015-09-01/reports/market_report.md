### Detailed Technical Analysis of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) - September 1, 2015

The following report analyzes the technical indicators for Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) as of September 1, 2015. The indicators chosen include both trend-following and momentum-based indicators, giving a comprehensive view of the stock's performance over the past month. 

#### Moving Averages:
1. **50 Simple Moving Average (SMA)**: 
   - As of September 1, 2015, the 50 SMA is **39.46**, indicating a slight downward trend. It serves as a dynamic support level, reflecting short to medium-term price behavior. The price action around this level reveals a potential weakness as the stock nears this average.

2. **200 Simple Moving Average (SMA)**:
   - The 200 SMA stands at **38.98**. This long-term average indicates a general bearish sentiment in the market. The current price is likely trading below this level, suggesting that the longer-term trend is down, which further supports caution in bullish assumptions.

3. **10 Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**:
   - The 10 EMA is recorded at **38.24**. This responsive indicator shows a significant dip as the recent closing prices have been notably lower. The EMA being below the 50 and 200 SMAs confirms a short-term bearish trend.

#### Momentum Indicators:
4. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**:
   - The MACD value of **-0.78** is indicative of a bearish momentum, especially since the MACD line is below zero. This suggests that there are no immediate bullish signals entering the market.

5. **MACD Signal**:
   - The corresponding MACD signal (smoothed line) stands at **-0.44**, which also reinforces the bearish sentiment. With both MACD and its signal line below zero, this implies that the stock is in a downward band.

6. **MACD Histogram**:
   - The histogram is a negative value at **-0.24**, confirming the squeeze between the MACD line and signal line. There’s notable momentum loss, suggesting sellers are currently weaker than the buyers.

7. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**:
   - At **43.08**, the RSI is in neutral territory, just above the threshold of 30 indicating oversold conditions. However, it is still well within the trading range without showing strong overbought or oversold signals.

#### Volatility Indicator:
8. **Average True Range (ATR)**:
   - The ATR shows a value of **1.13**, signaling a moderate level of volatility. This is crucial for adjusting position sizes and setting stop-loss levels, especially in the context of the wider market outlook.

### Summary of Observations:
- The trend indicators (50 SMA, 200 SMA, and 10 EMA) all point towards a bearish sentiment on MSFT, with the prices currently trading below these averages.
- The MACD indicators suggest a reaffirmation of bearish momentum with no signs of immediate reversal.
- The RSI indicates that the stock isn't oversold, allowing room for potential further declines or stabilizations ahead without hitting critical oversold levels.
- The ATR reflects moderate volatility, meaning that while price fluctuations might occur, they are not extreme.

### Recommended Action:
In light of the mixed indicators, particularly the downward-moving averages and bearish momentum signals, traders should exercise caution before making entries into long positions on MSFT. Given this analysis, it may be prudent to **HOLD** current positions until clearer bullish signals emerge, particularly in conjunction with upward movement in the price crossing above dynamic support levels.
