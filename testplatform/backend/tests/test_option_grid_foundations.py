"""The option entry rule must gate on a signal EVERY expert produces.

WHY THIS CHANGED. The four price_* gates read price_vs_target_low_percent /
price_vs_target_high_percent, and PriceVsTargetLowCondition is hard-keyed to
expert_recommendation.data["FMPRating"]["target_low"]. Only FMPRating writes target_low, so
under any other expert all four gates fail CLOSED -- 8 of ~28 genes per structure, and any
genome enabling one trades nothing. That is the pathology the launcher already records for the
confidence gate in opt 333 (enabled 0.80 in dead genomes vs 0.14 in trading ones).

expected_profit_percent is NON-NULLABLE on ExpertRecommendation, so every expert produces it,
and N_EXPECTED_PROFIT_TARGET_PERCENT already exists as a condition. target_price is nullable and
DERIVES from expected_profit_percent when absent -- the model's own field description says so --
so the two are the same signal and one gate replaces four.
