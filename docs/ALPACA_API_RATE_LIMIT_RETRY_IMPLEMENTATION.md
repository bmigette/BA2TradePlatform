# Alpaca API Rate Limit Retry Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive rate limit retry mechanism for all Alpaca API calls with exponential backoff (1s, 3s, 10s delays).

## Implementation Details

### Retry Decorator
- **Location**: `ba2_trade_platform/modules/accounts/AlpacaAccount.py` (lines 17-37)
- **Pattern**: Exponential backoff with 4 total attempts (1 original + 3 retries)
- **Delays**: 1 second, 3 seconds, 10 seconds between retries
- **Error Detection**: Catches `APIError` with "too many requests" message
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of retry attempts and final failure

### Protected API Methods
All Alpaca API methods now have rate limit protection:

1. **`get_orders`** (line 264) - Retrieves orders from broker
2. **`_submit_order_impl`** (line 288) - Submits new orders to broker
3. **`modify_order`** (line 451) - Modifies existing orders
4. **`get_order`** (line 481) - Retrieves specific order by ID
5. **`cancel_order`** (line 500) - Cancels orders
6. **`get_positions`** (line 519) - Retrieves account positions
7. **`get_account_info`** (line 555) - Retrieves account information
8. **`_get_instrument_current_price_impl`** (line 571) - Fetches current prices

### Verification
- **Test Script**: `test_files/test_alpaca_retry.py`
- **Test Results**: âœ… PASSED
  - Retry mechanism works correctly with proper delays
  - Exhausts retries appropriately when calls always fail
  - Succeeds when API calls recover after initial failures
  - Timing matches expected exponential backoff pattern

## Impact
- **Reliability**: Dramatically improved API reliability during high-traffic periods
- **Error Reduction**: Eliminates "too many requests" errors that were causing order sync issues
- **User Experience**: Orders and data refresh operations now automatically recover from rate limits
- **Robustness**: System can handle temporary API congestion without manual intervention

## Technical Notes
- Decorator preserves function signatures and return values
- Uses functools.wraps for proper function metadata preservation
- Error handling maintains original exception types for proper error propagation
- Logging provides clear visibility into retry behavior for debugging

## Next Steps
No further action required - all Alpaca API methods are now protected with appropriate retry logic.
