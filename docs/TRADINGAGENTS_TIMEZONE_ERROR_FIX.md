# TradingAgents Timezone and Error Handling Fix

## Problem 1: Timezone Comparison Error

**Error Message**:
```
TypeError: Invalid comparison between dtype=datetime64[ns, UTC] and datetime
Cannot compare tz-naive and tz-aware datetime-like objects
```

**Root Cause**:
- Yahoo Finance returns timezone-aware datetime data for intraday intervals (UTC timezone)
- The `MarketDataProvider` was comparing timezone-aware DataFrame dates with timezone-naive Python `datetime` objects
- Pandas requires both sides of comparison to have matching timezone awareness

**Solution**:
Modified `MarketDataProvider.py` to detect and handle timezone-aware DataFrames:

```python
# Make start_date and end_date timezone-aware if df['Date'] is timezone-aware
filter_start = start_date
filter_end = end_date
if hasattr(df['Date'], 'dt') and df['Date'].dt.tz is not None:
    # DataFrame has timezone-aware dates, convert filter dates to match
    from datetime import timezone as tz
    if start_date.tzinfo is None:
        filter_start = start_date.replace(tzinfo=tz.utc)
    if end_date.tzinfo is None:
        filter_end = end_date.replace(tzinfo=tz.utc)

# Filter to requested date range
mask = (df['Date'] >= filter_start) & (df['Date'] <= filter_end)
```

**Applied to**:
- `get_data()` method (line ~250)
- `get_dataframe()` method (line ~328)

## Problem 2: Graph Continues After Critical Errors

**Problem**:
- When tools like `get_YFin_data_online` encounter critical errors, they return `_error: True`
- The tool callback in `db_storage.py` correctly updates MarketAnalysis status to "FAILED"
- However, the graph execution continues running other agents/tools instead of stopping

**Root Cause**:
- The graph streaming loop had no mechanism to check if the analysis was marked as FAILED
- Graph would continue until natural completion, wasting API calls and time

**Solution**:

### 1. Added status check function in `db_storage.py`:
```python
def get_market_analysis_status(analysis_id: int) -> Optional[str]:
    """
    Get the current status of a MarketAnalysis record
    
    Args:
        analysis_id: MarketAnalysis ID
        
    Returns:
        Status string (e.g., "FAILED", "COMPLETED", "RUNNING") or None if not found
    """
    try:
        from ba2_trade_platform.core.db import get_instance
        from ba2_trade_platform.core.models import MarketAnalysis
        
        analysis = get_instance(MarketAnalysis, analysis_id)
        if analysis:
            return analysis.status.value if hasattr(analysis.status, 'value') else str(analysis.status)
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        ta_logger.error(f"Error getting MarketAnalysis {analysis_id} status: {e}", exc_info=True)
        return None
```

### 2. Updated graph streaming loop in `trading_graph.py`:
```python
for chunk in self.graph.stream(init_agent_state, **args):
    # Check if analysis has been marked as FAILED (e.g., by tool error callback)
    if self.market_analysis_id:
        from ..db_storage import get_market_analysis_status
        current_status = get_market_analysis_status(self.market_analysis_id)
        if current_status == "FAILED":
            ta_logger.error(f"Analysis {self.market_analysis_id} marked as FAILED, stopping graph execution")
            raise Exception("Analysis failed due to critical tool error - stopping graph execution")
    
    # ... process chunk ...
```

## Files Modified

1. **`ba2_trade_platform/core/MarketDataProvider.py`**
   - Fixed timezone comparison in `get_data()` method
   - Fixed timezone comparison in `get_dataframe()` method
   - Now handles both timezone-aware and timezone-naive dates correctly

2. **`ba2_trade_platform/thirdparties/TradingAgents/tradingagents/db_storage.py`**
   - Added `get_market_analysis_status()` helper function
   - Returns current analysis status as string

3. **`ba2_trade_platform/thirdparties/TradingAgents/tradingagents/graph/trading_graph.py`**
   - Added status check in debug mode streaming loop
   - Raises exception to stop graph execution if status is "FAILED"
   - Logs clear error message about why execution stopped

## Behavior Changes

### Before:
1. **Timezone Error**: Crash with TypeError when fetching intraday data
2. **Error Handling**: Graph would continue running all agents even after critical tool failures

### After:
1. **Timezone Handling**: Automatically detects and handles timezone-aware dates, no errors
2. **Error Handling**: Graph stops immediately when analysis is marked as FAILED

---

## Testing

After restart, verify:

1. **Timezone Fix**:
   - Run market analysis with 1-hour interval data
   - Should fetch and filter data without timezone errors
   - Check logs - no "Invalid comparison" errors

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Trigger a tool error (e.g., invalid symbol or network issue)
   - Tool callback should mark analysis as FAILED
   - Graph should stop execution immediately
   - Check logs for: "Analysis [ID] marked as FAILED, stopping graph execution"
   - No further tool calls should occur after FAILED status

---

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Robust Date Handling**: Works with both timezone-aware and timezone-naive dates
2. ✅ **Fast Failure**: Graph stops immediately on critical errors instead of wasting time
3. ✅ **API Call Savings**: Prevents unnecessary LLM/data provider calls after failure
4. ✅ **Clear Logging**: Explicit messages about why execution stopped
5. ✅ **Data Integrity**: Analysis status accurately reflects failure state

---

## Edge Cases Handled

- **Mixed Timezones**: Handles daily data (no timezone) and intraday data (UTC timezone) seamlessly
- **Already Timezone-Aware**: Doesn't double-convert dates that are already timezone-aware
- **No Market Analysis ID**: Status check is skipped for standalone graph execution
- **Database Errors**: Status check has error handling to prevent crashes during status lookup

---

## Future Enhancements

Consider:
1. Add status check in non-debug mode (currently only checks in debug streaming)
2. Implement retry logic for transient errors vs permanent failures
3. Add configurable timeout for graph execution
4. Store partial results even when analysis fails
